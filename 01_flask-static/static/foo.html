 Is this plaintext, though?

<!-- Q: What happens when you access this file via
         http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html
                 ?

        app.py prompts "GET /static/foo.html HTTP/1.1" 304 -

        We've also seen 200 and 404 in place of 304.

        The file cannot be found unless app.py is running

        everytime a change is made to this file, we get 200 after refreshing the webpage.


        However, the web browser can browse this .html file almost like a file explorer,
        by just adding some navigation to the url.
        Since this is a .html file, when we navigate to it, the web browser knows
        to just display it as a page.
