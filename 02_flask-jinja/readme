We are able to create a template, which is where we put the html code instead of in the return.
Inside of this html file, we can designate variables, that we will pass in as arguments when we use the template method.
This way, we can both have a html specific file, and be able to pass in information into it from our python code.
My guess is this'll allow us to make super dynamic websites.

And for once, we ain't rick rolling.
