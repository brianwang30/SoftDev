1. Settings Sync: The first and arguably most important step is installing Settings Sync, which syncronizes your VSCode customizations to Github. This way whenever you log into VSCode on a new device you can access your usual setup. Download [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)
2. Remote-SSH: This extension allows you to SSH into any machine as your development environment. This way you have access to your files and work on VSCode always. Download [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
3. Prettier: This extension automatically formats your code, and you can customize how it is formatted by default. Download[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
4. Bracket Pair Colorizer: This extension gives opening and closing brackets the same color, so the code is easier to read and edit. Download [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) 
5. Auto Rename Tag: This extension lets you simultaneously rename the opening and closing brackets. Download [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
